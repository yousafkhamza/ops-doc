### **GitHub Actions Interview Questions and Answers**

---

#### **Basic GitHub Actions Interview Questions**

---

#### **1. What is GitHub Actions, and why is it used?**
   - **Answer**: GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that enables automation of workflows directly within GitHub repositories. It is used to automate tasks like building, testing, and deploying code, integrating tightly with GitHubâ€™s source control and supporting custom workflows through YAML configurations.

---

#### **2. What is a workflow in GitHub Actions, and how is it defined?**
   - **Answer**: A **workflow** is an automated process defined in a YAML file stored in `.github/workflows` within a GitHub repository. Workflows consist of one or more jobs, which contain steps, such as commands or scripts to perform tasks. Workflows are triggered by specific events (e.g., `push`, `pull_request`).

---

#### **3. What are events in GitHub Actions? Provide examples.**
   - **Answer**: Events are specific activities in the repository that trigger workflows. Examples include:
     - `push`: Triggered when code is pushed to a branch.
     - `pull_request`: Triggered when a pull request is opened, updated, or merged.
     - `schedule`: Triggered based on a cron schedule.
     - `workflow_dispatch`: Triggered manually with custom input parameters.

---

#### **4. Explain the structure of a GitHub Actions workflow file.**
   - **Answer**:
     ```yaml
     name: CI Workflow  # Workflow name
     on:                # Trigger events
       push:
         branches:
           - main
     jobs:              # Define jobs
       build:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Runner environment
         steps:
           - name: Check out code
             uses: actions/checkout@v2
           - name: Set up Node.js
             uses: actions/setup-node@v2
             with:
               node-version: '14'
           - name: Run tests
             run: npm test
     ```

---

#### **5. What are jobs and steps in GitHub Actions?**
   - **Answer**:
     - **Job**: A job is a set of steps that runs on the same runner. Multiple jobs in a workflow can run sequentially or in parallel.
     - **Step**: A step is an individual task within a job. It can be a GitHub Action (prebuilt task) or a shell command/script.

---

#### **6. What are GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners?**
   - **Answer**:
     - **GitHub-hosted runners**: Managed by GitHub, providing pre-configured environments like `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, etc., to run jobs.
     - **Self-hosted runners**: Custom runners hosted by the user, which offer more control over the environment and resources.

---

#### **7. How do you pass secrets in GitHub Actions?**
   - **Answer**: Secrets are stored in the repository settings under **Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions** and can be referenced in workflows with `${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}`. Secrets are masked in logs for security.

---

### **Advanced GitHub Actions Interview Questions**

---

#### **1. What are reusable workflows, and how do they work?**
   - **Answer**: Reusable workflows allow teams to share and reuse workflow definitions across multiple repositories. They are defined in YAML files, and can be called using `workflow_call` in other workflows, reducing duplication and maintaining consistency.
     ```yaml
     jobs:
       deploy:
         uses: org/repo/.github/workflows/deploy.yml@main
         with:
           environment: "production"
     ```

#### **2. How do you create a matrix build in GitHub Actions?**
   - **Answer**: A matrix build allows testing across multiple configurations (e.g., Node versions, operating systems). Specify the `matrix` strategy in the job to create a matrix of possible configurations.
     ```yaml
     jobs:
       test:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         strategy:
           matrix:
             node: [12, 14, 16]
             os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
         steps:
           - name: Check out code
             uses: actions/checkout@v2
           - name: Set up Node.js
             uses: actions/setup-node@v2
             with:
               node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
           - run: npm test
     ```

---

#### **3. How do you handle artifacts in GitHub Actions?**
   - **Answer**: Artifacts are files generated during a workflow that can be stored and downloaded. Use the `actions/upload-artifact` and `actions/download-artifact` actions to manage artifacts.
     ```yaml
     - name: Upload artifact
       uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
       with:
         name: test-results
         path: results/
     ```

#### **4. How would you cache dependencies in GitHub Actions?**
   - **Answer**: The `actions/cache` action caches dependencies between builds to speed up workflow execution, especially for package managers like npm or pip.
     ```yaml
     - name: Cache Node modules
       uses: actions/cache@v2
       with:
         path: ~/.npm
         key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
         restore-keys: |
           ${{ runner.os }}-node-
     ```

#### **5. Describe the purpose of `jobs.<job_id>.needs` in GitHub Actions.**
   - **Answer**: The `needs` keyword defines job dependencies, ensuring that a job only starts after specified jobs complete successfully. It enables sequential workflows and conditional job execution.
     ```yaml
     jobs:
       build:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - run: echo "Build step"
       test:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         needs: build
         steps:
           - run: echo "Test step"
     ```

---

#### **6. Explain how to run a workflow on multiple branches or tags.**
   - **Answer**: Use the `on` keyword with `push` and specify branches or tags.
     ```yaml
     on:
       push:
         branches:
           - main
           - release/*
         tags:
           - 'v*'
     ```

---

### **Scenario-Based GitHub Actions Questions**

---

#### **1. Scenario: Workflow Fails Due to Authentication Errors**

- **Issue**: Workflow fails because GitHub fails to authenticate with a service (e.g., Docker, AWS).
- **Fix**:
  - Ensure correct secrets are configured in **Settings > Secrets**.
  - Use the secrets in the workflow to authenticate:
    ```yaml
    - name: Log in to Docker Hub
      uses: docker/login-action@v1
      with:
        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}
    ```

---

#### **2. Scenario: Need to Set Up Conditional Workflow Execution**

- **Question**: How would you execute a job only for certain conditions?
- **Answer**: Use the `if` keyword within a job or step to conditionally run based on expressions, such as branch name, event type, or environment.
    ```yaml
    jobs:
      build:
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - run: echo "Running only on main branch"
    ```

---

#### **3. Scenario: Workflow Execution Time Optimization**

- **Question**: How do you reduce workflow execution time?
- **Answer**:
  - Use **dependency caching** to avoid redundant downloads (e.g., `actions/cache`).
  - Use **matrix builds** for parallelization.
  - Run jobs on specific branches only when needed.

---

#### **4. Scenario: Handling Secrets in Pull Requests from Forks**

- **Question**: How do you securely use secrets in workflows triggered by pull requests from forks?
- **Answer**: Secrets are not exposed by default in workflows triggered by pull requests from forks. One way to handle this is to create conditional steps that skip actions requiring secrets when the workflow is triggered from an external pull request.

---

#### **5. Scenario: Need for Manual Workflow Trigger with Custom Parameters**

- **Question**: How do you trigger a workflow manually and pass custom parameters?
- **Answer**: Use `workflow_dispatch` with inputs to define parameters for manual execution.
    ```yaml
    on:
      workflow_dispatch:
        inputs:
          environment:
            description: 'Environment to deploy to'
            required: true
            default: 'production'
    ```
