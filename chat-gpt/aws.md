---

### **4. What is an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)?**
- **Answer**: A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a virtual network within AWS that provides full control over network configuration. It allows users to define their IP address range, create subnets, route tables, and security settings, and connect to on-premises networks.

---

### **5. What is S3 (Simple Storage Service)?**
- **Answer**: S3 is a highly scalable object storage service provided by AWS. It is used for storing and retrieving any amount of data, such as backups, application data, and large media files. S3 provides durability, availability, and scalability for object storage.

---

### **6. What is Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)?**
- **Answer**: Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, to ensure high availability and reliability. ELB can be configured to work with applications in a VPC and provides scaling for applications.

**Types of ELBs**:
  - **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Ideal for HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
  - **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**: For extreme performance and handling TCP traffic.
  - **Classic Load Balancer**: Legacy option for simple load balancing.

### **7. What is IAM (Identity and Access Management) in AWS?**
- **Answer**: IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a service that allows you to securely control access to AWS resources. With IAM, you can create and manage users, groups, roles, and permissions to grant or restrict access to specific AWS resources.

---

### **8. What is AWS Lambda?**
- **Answer**: AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You can upload your code, and Lambda takes care of the rest, including scaling and managing the execution environment.

---

### **9. What is Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)?**
- **Answer**: Amazon RDS is a managed relational database service that supports multiple database engines, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server. It automates database management tasks like backups, patching, and scaling.

---

### **10. What is Amazon CloudWatch?**
- **Answer**: Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that provides data and actionable insights into AWS resources, applications, and services. It can monitor metrics, collect logs, and set alarms for proactive alerting and troubleshooting.

---

### **11. What is AWS CloudFormation?**
- **Answer**: AWS CloudFormation is an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) service that allows you to define and provision AWS resources in a predictable and consistent manner using JSON or YAML templates. CloudFormation makes it easier to automate resource provisioning and management.

---

### **12. What are Security Groups in AWS?**
- **Answer**: Security groups are virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances. You can specify rules to allow or deny traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.

---

### **13. What is an Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)?**
- **Answer**: Amazon EBS is a block-level storage service that provides persistent storage for EC2 instances. EBS volumes can be attached to running EC2 instances and used for storing data such as operating systems, databases, and application files.

---

### **14. What is the difference between EC2 and Lambda?**
- **Answer**:
  - **EC2**: Offers full control over virtual machines, with the ability to configure the operating system and environment. It is suitable for long-running workloads.
  - **Lambda**: Serverless compute service where you only manage the code. AWS manages the environment, scaling, and execution. It is suitable for short-lived, event-driven applications.

---

### **15. What are the different types of storage options available in AWS?**
- **Answer**:
  - **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: Object storage for unstructured data.
  - **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**: Persistent block storage for EC2 instances.
  - **EFS (Elastic File System)**: Fully managed file storage that can be shared across multiple instances.
  - **Glacier**: Low-cost storage for data archiving and long-term backups.

---

### **16. What is the difference between a public and private subnet in AWS?**
- **Answer**:
  - **Public Subnet**: A subnet with a route to the internet, allowing resources (such as EC2 instances) in that subnet to directly access the internet.
  - **Private Subnet**: A subnet without direct access to the internet. Resources in a private subnet must use a NAT gateway or instance for internet access.

---

### **17. What is Amazon Route 53?**
- **Answer**: Amazon Route 53 is a scalable and highly available Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It routes end-user requests to endpoints in AWS, such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, or CloudFront distributions, and can also be used to manage domain registration.

### **Scenario-Based AWS Questions**

---

### **1. Scenario: Scaling EC2 Instances for High Traffic**
- **Question**: Your EC2 instance is experiencing high traffic during peak hours, and it is causing performance degradation. How would you scale the resources to handle the increased load?
- **Answer**:
  - **Horizontal Scaling**: Use **Auto Scaling** to automatically add EC2 instances based on the demand. Define an Auto Scaling group with minimum, maximum, and desired instance counts and set scaling policies based on CPU utilization or network traffic.
  - **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**: Configure an ELB to distribute incoming traffic across all EC2 instances.
  - **CloudWatch Monitoring**: Set up CloudWatch alarms to monitor CPU usage and trigger scaling actions when thresholds are met.

---

### **2. Scenario: Troubleshooting EC2 Instance Access Issues**
- **Question**: A user is unable to access their EC2 instance over SSH. How would you troubleshoot the issue?
- **Answer**:
  - Check the **Security Group** rules to ensure that inbound traffic on port 22 (SSH) is allowed.
  - Verify that the EC2 instance has an **Elastic IP** assigned or is accessible via a public IP.
  - Ensure that the **Network ACLs** are not blocking the SSH port.
  - Check the **instanceâ€™s system logs** via the EC2 console to see if the instance is running properly.

---

### **3. Scenario: Automating Infrastructure Deployment with CloudFormation**
- **Question**: You need to automate the deployment of a multi-tier web application on AWS using AWS CloudFormation. How would you achieve this?
- **Answer**:
  - Create a **CloudFormation template** in YAML or JSON to define all AWS resources like EC2 instances, RDS databases, S3 buckets, and ELB.
  - Define the necessary **parameters** in the template to customize configurations such as instance types, region, and database configurations.
  - Use the **CloudFormation console or CLI** to launch the stack, which will automatically provision the resources based on the template.
  - Set up **outputs** in the template to capture key information such as ELB URL or instance IDs after stack creation.

---

### **4. Scenario: Backup Strategy for AWS Data**
- **Question**: You need to implement a backup strategy for critical data stored on S3. How would you set this up to ensure durability and accessibility?
- **Answer**:
  - Enable **versioning** on S3 buckets to retain old versions of objects in case of accidental deletion or corruption.
  - Set up **lifecycle policies** to automatically move data to more cost-effective storage classes like **S3 Glacier** after a specified retention period.
  - Use **AWS Backup

** for automated backup management across services like EC2, RDS, and EFS.
  - Set up cross-region replication for disaster recovery by replicating data to a different AWS region.

---

### **5. Scenario: Ensuring Secure Access to AWS Resources**
- **Question**: How would you ensure secure access to AWS resources, such as EC2 instances and S3 buckets, while following the principle of least privilege?
- **Answer**:
  - Use **IAM roles** to grant the minimum required permissions for EC2 instances, Lambda functions, or other services.
  - Implement **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** for users accessing the AWS Management Console to enhance security.
  - Use **IAM policies** to fine-tune permissions and ensure users and roles only have access to the resources they need.
  - Restrict **S3 bucket access** using **bucket policies** and **IAM policies**, and consider enabling **encryption** for sensitive data.
